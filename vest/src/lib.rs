//! Vest is a *formally verified* library for parsing and serializing binary data, using combinators.
//!
//! # Background
//!
//! **Parsing and serialization of binary data**
//!
//! In the context of binary formats, parsing refers to the process of interpreting raw byte
//! sequences as structured data, while serialization refers to the reverse process of encoding
//! structured data as raw byte sequences. Binary formats are essential in domains like network
//! protocols, file systems, and embedded systems, where data is often transmitted or stored in
//! a compact binary form.
//!
//! **Formally verified parsing and serialization**
//!
//! Binary formats are notoriously difficult to parse and serialize correctly, due to the
//! complexity of the formats and the potential for errors in the implementation. Vest aims to
//! address this problem by *formally verifying* the correctness and security of the parsing and
//! serialization code using the Rust type system and [Verus](https://github.com/verus-lang/verus),
//! a deductive verification tool for Rust.
//!
//! We don't use `unsafe` so the Rust type system provides us with strong guarantees about the
//! memory safety of the code. We use Verus to verify the more nuanced properties of the code,
//! such as the top-level round-trip properties of the parsing and serialization functions.
//! - For every binary sequence `b`, if `parse(b)` succeeds, producing a result `(n, m)`, then
//! `serialize(m)` should reproduce the original input `b`, truncated to `n` bytes.
//! - For every structured data `m`, if `serialize(m)` succeeds, producing a binary sequence `b`,
//! then `parse(b)` should successfully consuming the entire input `b` and produce the original
//! structured data `m`.
//!
//! These round-trip properties ensure that the parsing and serialization functions are mutual
//! inverses and hence immune to parser malleability attacks ([EverParse](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/everparse/))
//! and format confusion attacks ([Comparse](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3576915.3623201)).
//!
//! **Parser and serializer combinators**
//!
//! It's certainly possible to implement and verify parsers and serializers for single protocol
//! formats or file formats manually, but this approach is tedious, and not reusable. Binary
//! formats often share common patterns, such as fixed-size fields, variable-size fields, a
//! sequence of fields, a tagged union of fields, etc. Vest provides a set of parser and serializer
//! combinators that can be used to build complex parsers and serializers from simple ones, where
//! the properties of the combinators are verified once and for all.
//!
//! # Example: Parsing and serializing a pair of bytes
//!
//! ```rust
//! use vest::regular::bytes::Bytes;
//!
//! let pair_of_bytes = (Bytes(1), Bytes(2));
//!
//! let input = &[0x10; 10];
//! let (consumed, (a, b)) = pair_of_bytes.parse(input)?;
//!
//! let mut output = vec![0x00; 40];
//! let written = pair_of_bytes.serialize((a, b), &mut output, 0)?;
//!
//! proof { pair_of_bytes.theorem_parse_serialize_roundtrip(input@); }
//! assert(written == consumed);
//! assert(&output[..written]@, &input[..written]@);
//! ```
//!
//! # Example: Constructing a new combinator
//!
//! ```rust
//! use vest::regular::uints::U8;
//! use vest::regular::refined::{Refined, Pred};
//!
//! pub struct EvenU8;
//! impl Pred for EvenU8 {
//!     type Input<'a> = u8;
//!     fn apply(&self, i: &Self::Input<'_>) -> bool {
//!         *i % 2 == 0
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let even_u8 = Refined { inner: U8, predicate: EvenU8 };
//!
//! let mut output = vec![0x00; 40];
//! let ten = 10u8;
//! let written = even_u8.serialize(ten, &mut output, 0)?;
//!
//! let (consumed, parsed) = even_u8.parse(output.as_slice())?;
//!
//! proof { even_u8.theorem_serialize_parse_roundtrip(ten@); }
//! assert(written == consumed);
//! assert(parsed@, ten@);
//! ```
